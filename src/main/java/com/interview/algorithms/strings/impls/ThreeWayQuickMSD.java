 * use 3-way quick sort to partition the sub array into three part: smaller than the pivot, equal to the pivot, larger than the pivot by swap and keep the margin using small, greater position.
 *
 * It's using quick sort algorithm rather than traditional MSD which is using index array counting.
 *
 * As it's using comparison between strings, so the average performance should be lower bounded by 2NLogN compares.
